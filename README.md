## PROJECT DETAILS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview
The application will process and validate warranty claims. Set up a database of existing warranties. Read in list of warranty claims. If the claim is valid, store it in the
database. If it's not valid, log this information in a local file.

Objectives:
  - Analyze requirements and develop the design for a Java integration application.
  - Open, read and print files.
  - Connect to and read/write to an Autonomous Database.
  - Implement application logic to check record formats and check database records for validity.
  - Connect to and capture data from a REST service.
